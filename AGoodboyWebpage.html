            <h2>Anime</h2>
            <p>Every goodboy with respect for himself is an avid anime-watcher. Here is a couple of suggestions for great animes!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sailor Moon</li>
                    <li>One Piece</li>
                    <li>Naruto</li>
                    <li>Dragon Ball Z</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Memes</h2>
            <p>Except this video is not a meme. It is very serious.</p>            
            <video src="./normiesREEEEEE.mp4" width="" height="" controls>
                Video not supported
            </video>
            <p>All jokes aside... The whole internet seems to treat us goodboys as living memes. We do not like being treated this way, but for now we aknowledge that it is a fight we cannot win in the forseeable future. 
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we just ignore these normies in our everyday lives.</p>
            <p>Some of us are, however, also dank memesters ourselves as illustrated by the memes on r/dankmemes on Reddit.</p>
            <p>

                </a> 
            </p>
            <p>Below is an example of a crude meme that makes fun of our luxurious goodboy lifestyle. REEEEE.</p>

            <h2>The Great War on Chads</h2>
            <p>As you probably know the relationship between Chads and goodboys is in a very poor state.</p>
            <p>It is as if the Chads have dedicated their lives to annoy the good little boys</p>
            <p>Here is a list of characteristics that can help <em>you</em> spot a Chad in the wild:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>He is into sports and exercising (Yucky!)</li>
                    <li>He likes sauces like ketchup, barbecue sauce and ranch dressing</li>
                    <li>He would like you to eat vegetals and exercise more in order for you to become more malnourished</li>
                    <li>He shows little to no respect for your hobbies like anime, vidya gaemz, your waifu and Magic cards</li>
                    <li>He tries to influence your bitch mommy to not cook tendies for you</li>
                </ol>
            <p>All in all, Chads should be treated as your worst enemy. Therefore you should prepare defensive meassures to counteract his viscious attempts on your life.</p>
            <p>These countermeassures can include: piss jugs, your migthy samurai sword, poop smearings, autistic screeching etc.</p>
            <p>Defensive like these can force the Chad to step down and leave you alone, as you so desperately desire.</p>
