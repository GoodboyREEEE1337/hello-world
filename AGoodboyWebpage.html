                Video not supported

            <p>All jokes aside... The whole internet seems to treat us goodboys as living memes. We do not like being
                treated this way, but for now we aknowledge that it is a fight we cannot win in the forseeable future.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we just ignore these normies in our everyday lives.</p>
            <p>Some of us are, however, also dank memesters ourselves as illustrated by the memes on r/dankmemes on
                Reddit.</p>

            <h2 class="header" id="The-war">The Great War on Chads</h2>
            <p>As you probably know the relationship between Chads and goodboys is in a very poor state.</p>
            <p>It is as if the Chads have dedicated their lives to annoy the good little boys</p>
            <p>Here is a list of characteristics that can help <em>you</em> spot a Chad in the wild:</p>
            <ol class="ordered-list">
                <li>He is into sports and exercising (Yucky!)</li>
                <li>He likes sauces like ketchup, barbecue sauce and ranch dressing</li>
                <li>He would like you to eat vegetals and exercise more in order for you to become more malnourished</li>
                <li>He shows little to no respect for your hobbies like anime, vidya gaemz, your waifu and Magic cards</li>
                <li>He tries to influence your bitch mommy to stop cooking tendies for you</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All in all, Chads should be treated as your worst enemy. Therefore you should prepare defensive measures
                to counteract his viscious attempts on your life.</p>
            <p>These countermeasures can include: piss jugs, your migthy samurai sword, poop smearings, autistic
                screeching etc.</p>
            <p>Defensive measures like these can force the Chad to step down and leave you alone, as you so desperately
                desire.</p>
